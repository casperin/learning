# Playing with Generators and CSP

These are some examples designed as a fast introduction to Generators and how
they can work with CSP [Communicating sequential
processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes).

Generators are excellent for working with async programming, and they will be
coming to a browser near you soon, so why not get up to speed on them?

It won't explain *everything* there is to know about Generators (or CSP), far
from it. Only enough to get you started. With time, I may expand on it as my
own knowledge grows.

These have been my primary sources to rip off. This is where you should go to
understand more on the topic.
