# Simple JavaScript examples

Right now, there is only examples of generators and csp, so everything below
addresses that.

## How should I work with this?

Clone this project. Open a folder and the index, and uncomment the first
javascript example. Then open that and read. Edit it and experiment until you
feel you understand what is going on. Don't worry, you can just clone another
one if you need a clean slate. When you feel you understand what is going on in
one file, move on to the next.

I've tried to make it as simple as possible, and then even simpler. To cut
everything irrelevant away when introducing new concepts. Then build upon them.
Slowly. If you feel you can improve upon that, then by all means, send a pull
request.
