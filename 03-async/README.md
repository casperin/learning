# A quick dive into `async function`

Coming in `es7` is the new [`async` functions](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait). They
are already available via [babel](http://babeljs.io), and in [React
Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) which I'm working with at the moment, so I thought
it'd be time to throw a little time after understanding them.
